This repository contains the cloud-based implementation of the Sneaky Snake algorithm, which is part of a final year project based on the thesis "Hands on Algorithm Acceleration using Heterogeneous Computing Systems". The implementation was deployed on an Azure-based virtual machine to test and profile the performance of the Sneaky Snake algorithm in a cloud environment.

**Key Details:**

- **Algorithm**: Sneaky Snake, a pre-alignment filter used in genome sequencing.
- **Cloud Platform**: Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine.
- **Focus**: Performance profiling and scalability of the algorithm in a cloud computing environment.
- **Implementation**: The code leverages parallel processing capabilities to handle large datasets efficiently, using multiple threads to process reads in parallel.

This implementation is a significant part of the project's exploration into the benefits of heterogeneous computing systems, showcasing the potential of cloud computing in handling computationally intensive bioinformatics applications.
